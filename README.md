The retro game of Snake in all of its glory made in the pygame library in python

This was made with the _pygame_ library in python

Run ```pip install pygame``` in the terminal/command prompt and then run the program, it should run perfectly fine afterwards

Use the arrow keys to move the snake, at the "Game Over" screen press "1" to exit the game or press "2" to restart.
